        "Welcome to our JAX tutorial for the Deep Learning course at the University of Amsterdam! The following notebook is meant to give a short introduction to JAX, including writing and training your own neural networks with [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). But why should you learn JAX, if there are already so many other deep learning frameworks like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)? The short answer: because it can be extremely fast. For instance, a small GoogleNet on CIFAR10, which we discuss in detail in [Tutorial 5](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html), can be trained in JAX 3x faster than in PyTorch with a similar setup. Note that for larger models, larger batch sizes, or smaller GPUs, a considerably smaller speedup is expected, and the code has not been designed for benchmarking. Nonetheless, JAX enables this speedup by compiling functions and numerical programs for accelerators (GPU/TPU) *just in time*, finding the optimal utilization of the hardware. Frameworks with dynamic computation graphs like PyTorch cannot achieve the same efficiency, since they cannot anticipate the next operations before the user calls them. For example, in an Inception block of GoogleNet, we apply multiple convolutional layers in parallel on the same input. JAX can optimize the execution of this layer by compiling the whole forward pass for the available accelerator and fusing operations where possible, reducing memory access and speeding up execution. In contrast, when calling the first convolutional layer in PyTorch, the framework does not know that multiple convolutions on the same feature map will follow. It sends each operation one by one to the GPU, and can only adapt the execution after seeing the next Python calls. Hence, JAX can make more efficient use of the GPU than, for instance, PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, everything comes with a price. In order to efficiently compile programs just-in-time in JAX, the functions need to be written with certain constraints. Firstly, the functions are not allowed to have side-effects, meaning that they are not allowed to affect any variable outside of their namespaces. For instance, in-place operations affect a variable even outside of the function. Moreover, stochastic operations such as `torch.rand(...)` change the global state of pseudo random number generators, which is not allowed in functional JAX (we will see later how JAX handles random number generation). Secondly, JAX compiles the functions based on anticipated shapes of all arrays/tensors in the function. This becomes problematic if the shapes or the program flow within the function depends on the values of the tensor. For instance, in the operation `y = x[x>3]`, the shape of `y` depends on how many values of `x` are greater than 3. We will discuss more of these constraints in this notebook. Still, in most common cases of training neural networks, it is straightforward to write functions within these constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is heavily inspired by many great JAX tutorials before, and a (non-exclusive) list of them are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* [JAX 101](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/index.html) with many subtutorials on individual parts of JAX\n",

JAX is not meant to 'redefine the wheel', so we can combine it framework-agnostic parts from PyTorch (e.g., data loading) and TensorFlow (e.g., logging in TensorBoard). Further, we use [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a neural network library in JAX, and [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to implement common deep learning optimizers. More on them later in the notebook. First, let's get started with some basic JAX operations."

        "A technical detail of running operations on DeviceArrays is that when a JAX function is called, the corresponding operation takes place asynchronously on the accelerator when possible. For instance, if we call `out = jnp.matmul(b, b)`, JAX first returns a placeholder array for `out` which may not be filled with the values as soon as the function calls finishes. This way, Python will not block the execution of follow-up statements, but instead only does it whenever we strictly need the value of `out`, for instance for printing or putting it on CPU. PyTorch uses a very similar principle to allow asynchronous computation. For more details, see [JAX - Asynchronous Dispatch](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async_dispatch.html)."

        "When we would like to change a NumPy array in-place, like replacing the first element of `b` with `1` instead of `0`, we could simply write `b[0]=1`. However, in JAX, this is not possible. A `DeviceArray` object is *immutable*, which means that no in-place operations are possible. The reason for this goes back to our discussion in the introduction: JAX requires programs to be \"pure\" functions, i.e. no effects on variables outside of the function are allowed. Allowing in-place operations of variables would make the program analysis for JAX's just-in-time compilation difficult. Instead, we can use the expression `b.at[0].set(1)` which, analogous to the in-place operation, returns a new array which is identical to `b`, except that its value at the first position is 1. Let's try that out below:"

        "\n",
        "In machine learning, we come across several situations where we need to generate pseudo random numbers: randomly shuffling a dataset, sampling a dropout mask for regularization, training a VAE by sampling from the approximate posterior, etc. In libraries like NumPy and PyTorch, the random number generator are controlled by a seed, which we set initially to obtain the same samples every time we run the code (this is why the numbers are not truly random, hence \"pseudo\"-random). However, if we call `np.random.normal()` 5 times consecutively, we will get 5 different numbers since every execution changes the state/seed of the pseudo random number generation (PRNG). In JAX, if we would try to generate a random number with this approach, a function creating pseudo-random number would have an effect outside of it. To prevent this, JAX takes a different approach by explicitly passing and iterating the PRNG state. First, let's create a PRNG for the seed 42:"

        "\n",
        "> The most important difference, and in some sense the root of all the rest, is that JAX is designed to be functional, as in functional programming. The reason behind this is that the kinds of program transformations that JAX enables are much more feasible in functional-style programs. [...] The important feature of functional programming to grok when working with JAX is very simple: don’t write code with side-effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, we want to write our main code of JAX in functions that do not affect anything else besides its outputs. For instance, we do not want to change input arrays in-place, or access global variables. While this might seem limiting at first, you get used to this quite quickly and most JAX functions that need to fulfill these constraints can be written this way without problems. Note that not all possible functions in training a neural network need to fulfill the constraints. For instance, loading or saving of models, the logging, or the data generation can be done in naive functions. Only the network execution, which we want to do very efficiently on our accelerator (GPU or TPU), should strictly follow these constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "What does make JAX functions so special, and how can we think about them? A good way of gaining understanding in how JAX handles function is to understand its intermediate representation: jaxpr. Conceptually, you can think of any operation that JAX does on a function, as first trace-specializing the Python function to be transformed into a small and well-behaved intermediate form. This means that we check which operations are performed on which array, and what shapes the arrays are. Based on this representation, JAX then interprets the function with transformation-specific interpretation rules, which includes automatic differentiation or compiling a function in XLA to efficiently use the accelerator.\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate this intermediate representation, let's consider the same simple function we used in the [PyTorch tutorial](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial2/Introduction_to_PyTorch.html) to discuss the concept of dynamic computation graphs:\n",

Intuitively, the gradient of taking the mean is independent of the actual output of the mean, hence we could drop `f` and `g` without any drawback. Finding such cases to improve efficiency and optimizing the code to take full advantage of the available accelerator hardware is one of the big selling points of JAX. It achieves that by *compiling functions just-in-time* with [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) (Accelerated Linear Algebra), using their jaxpr representation. Thereby, XLA fuses operations to reduce execution time of short-lived operations and eliminates intermediate storage buffers where not needed. For more details, see the [XLA documentation](https://docs.w3cub.com/tensorflow~guide/performance/xla/index).\n",

        "The main, obvious difference to PyTorch is that Flax uses lazy initialization. The function `setup` is called once on a module instance before any other methods are called, or when you try to access a attribute of *self* defined in setup. Additional object attributes are defined below the class name. However, in contrast to PyTorch, the parameters are not part of the module. Instead, we can create a set of parameters of the module by calling its `init()` function. This function takes as input a PRNG state for sampling pseudo-random numbers and an example input to the model, and returns a set of parameters for the module as a pytree. Further, since the init function requires an input to the network, we can infer the input shape for all modules and do not need to explicitly define it during the module creation. This becomes more clear in the example we show in a second.\n",

        "\n",
        "The class `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` represents a Python iterable over a dataset with support for automatic batching, multi-process data loading and many more features. The data loader communicates with the dataset using the function `__getitem__`, and stacks its outputs as tensors over the first dimension to form a batch.\n",
        "In contrast to the dataset class, we usually don't have to define our own data loader class, but can just create an object of it with the dataset as input. Additionally, we can configure our data loader with the following input arguments (only a selection, see full list [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader)):\n",
        "\n",
        "* `batch_size`: Number of samples to stack per batch\n",
        "* `shuffle`: If True, the data is returned in a random order. This is important during training for introducing stochasticity.\n",
        "* `num_workers`: Number of subprocesses to use for data loading. The default, 0, means that the data will be loaded in the main process which can slow down training for datasets where loading a data point takes a considerable amount of time (e.g. large images). More workers are recommended for those, but can cause issues on Windows computers. For tiny datasets as ours, 0 workers are usually faster.\n",
        "* `persistent_workers`: If True, workers will not be shutdown after an iteration over the dataset has finished. This can be useful if the time per epoch is small, or if you face issues with workers being killed during training.\n",
        "* `drop_last`: If True, the last batch is dropped in case it is smaller than the specified batch size. This occurs when the dataset size is not a multiple of the batch size. Only potentially helpful during training to keep a consistent batch size.\n",
        "* `collate_fn`: A function that defines how the elements per batch are combined. By default, PyTorch stacks them as PyTorch tensors. For JAX, we will change it to NumPy arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's create a simple data loader below with a function that stacks batch elements as NumPy array instead of PyTorch Tensors:"

In these cases, it is recommend to pad the batches to prevent many re-compilations (see Flax's [padding guide](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtos/full_eval.html) for details).

Already for batching the elements, we need to apply padding, such that the shape of the batch is determined by the largest sentence in the batch. However, this largest length can vary between batches, especially when we shuffle the dataset before each epoch. In PyTorch, this is not a problem, since the dynamic computation graph allows us to stop the computation whenever we need to. In contrast, JAX would need to recompile the forward pass for every single largest sentence length, which can quickly become very expensive. Padding is needed to reduce the number of compilations, but at the same time introduces unnecessary computation. Hence, we have a tradeoff between number of compilations and extra compute per batch. In the extreme case, PyTorch may even become faster than JAX here.\n",

Furthermore, there can be issues when tracking NaNs in your code (see the [sharp bits tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#debugging-nans)), and errors like out-of-bounds indexing are silently handled on accelerators by returning -1 instead of an error (see the corresponding section in the [sharp bits tutorial](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#out-of-bounds-indexing)). However, if necessary, one can either run the unjitted version of the forward pass first, and even introduce print statements to the jitted version where needed (see [here](https://github.com/google/jax/issues/196) for a great explanation).

For instance, dropout randomly masks out a number of neurons during training, but leaves the graph untouched during evaluation. In PyTorch, we can easily switch between the two states via `model.train()` and `model.eval()` without having to manually specify it in the dropout module instance. However, in JAX, we do not have global states in the model, and thus need to pass this information to every module in the forward pass that may need it. In our example above, this was not needed, since the forward pass of the simple classifier is identical during training and evaluation. Alternatively, since the parameters are not bound to a specific model during training, one can also create two models: one training model, and one evaluation model. Nonetheless, one still needs to add the information to every module with changing behaviors, which adds a certain overhead compared to PyTorch. We will discuss two common modules with such behaviors below: dropout and BatchNorm."

Fortunately, we do not have to pass this state in every PRNG state, but instead, can simply pass `rngs={'dropout': dropout_rng}` with `dropout_rng` being the PRNG state. For an example, see our [Tutorial 6](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial6/Transformers_and_MHAttention.html) on Transformers in which we use dropout in several occasions."

        "\n",
        "Batch Normalization transforms the input in two different ways. During training, we determine the mean and standard deviation of the input, and normalize the data with it to a zero mean and standard deviation of one. During evaluation, on the other hand, we take a running statistic over the previous several batches, and use those to estimate the mean and standard deviation. This is necessary to keep the evaluation stable and invariant to the specific batches we choose. Still, in the Flax module ([documentation](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/flax.linen.BatchNorm.html)), we need to give the argument `use_running_average` (bool) to either the constructor or each forward pass. Furthermore, BatchNorm has a specific property we haven't discussed yet and is a bit tricky in JAX: keeping track of the running average. During every forward pass, we want to record the mean and standard deviation of the current batch, and update our current average over the past batches. However, this requires changing an input tensor, and returning this changed tensor again. In Flax, we can do this by defining the batch statistics as a mutable tensor. Check out our [Tutorial 5](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html) to see BatchNorm being used in practice with Flax."
